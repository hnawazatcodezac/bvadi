      },
      "question_five": {
        "question": "What is the difference between front-end and back-end development?",
        "answer": "Front-end development focuses on the parts of a website that users interact with, such as layout, design, and user interface. It involves technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Back-end development, on the other hand, deals with the server-side of the website, managing databases, server logic, and application performance, often using languages like PHP, Python, or Node.js. Both are crucial for a fully functional website."
      },
      "question_six": {
        "question": "Will my website be optimized for SEO?",
        "answer": "Yes, your website can be optimized for SEO by following best practices such as using relevant keywords, creating high-quality content, optimizing meta tags and images, improving page load speed, and ensuring mobile responsiveness. Additionally, tools like Google Analytics and Search Console can be used to track performance and make data-driven improvements over time."
